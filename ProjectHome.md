# Overview #

> QUPnP is a reference implementation of [UPnP](http://www.upnp.org/) protocol stack. It provides simple APIs to write UPnP devices and control points. It is designed to conform to [UPnP Device Architecture v1.1](http://www.upnp.org/specs/arch/UPnP-arch-DeviceArchitecture-v1.1.pdf). QUPnP is written in Qt. [Qt](http://qt.nokia.com/) is a cross-platform application and UI framework. Using Qt, you can write web-enabled applications once and deploy them across desktop, mobile and embedded operating systems without rewriting the source code.

> In the beginning phase, QUPnP aims to port [GUPnP](http://www.gupnp.org/) framework to Qt platform. GUPnP is an object-oriented open source framework for creating UPnP devices and control points, written in C using GObject and libsoup. The GUPnP API is intended to be easy to use, efficient and flexible. In addition, GUPnP is also a component in MeeGo's media services, providing UPnP functionalities. As we known, [MeeGo](http://meego.org/) is an open source, Linux project which brings together the Moblin project, headed up by Intel, and Maemo, by Nokia, into a single open source activity.

> Although QUPnP is just a porting of GUPnP, it is not all. Our goal is to create a Qt-based UPnP SDK, more Qt and fully UPnP v1.1 compatible. We can see that Qt will be more and more popular in the near future. Like Qt intuitive APIs, we want to create a UPnP SDK with very simple but powerful APIs to write UPnP devices and control points.

> Anyway, we really want more guys to join us. Just contribute to this project!
